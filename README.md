# DIGITAL TWIN RETROSPECTIVE
There have been some implementations of large-scale urban Digital Twins.
However, this endeavor presents challenges in production, coordination, and long-term
maintenance while preserving an alluring visual quality. This study presents three
cases of large-scale urban digital environments, examining how those challenges were
addressed using video game industry technology and evaluating them against three
taxonomies described in recent literature to determine if any qualify as an actual Digital
Twin. Lastly, we propose possible improvements to address a perceived lack of
robustness in some criterias. Besides we comment on the possible use of this kind of
tool for didactic use.
